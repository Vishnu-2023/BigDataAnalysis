Design Thinking: 1. Data Selection: Sea level datasets, in the context of climate and environmental science, refer to collections of data that record and measure various aspects of sea level in different locations and over time. These datasets are essential for monitoring changes in sea level, understanding the causes of those changes, and assessing the potential impacts on coastal areas. 2.Database Setup: Database setup is the initial design and configuration of a digital storage system that defines data structures, schemas, and access controls to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for various applications and users. 3.Data Exploration: Data exploration for a sea level dataset is the early stage of analysis where the dataset is scrutinized through summary statistics, visualizations, and basic statistical techniques to reveal underlying trends, anomalies, and relevant features, aiding in the formulation of research questions and hypotheses for more in-depth analysis. 4.Analysis technique: Big-data analysis is a very active research area with significant impact on industrial and scientific domains where is important to analyze very large and complex data repositories. In particular, in many cases data to be analyzed are stored in cloud platforms and elastic computing clouds facilities are exploited to speed-up the analysis. 5.Visualization: Virtualization is technology that you can use to create virtual representations of servers, storage, networks, and other physical machines. 6.Business Insights: A business insight combines data and analysis to find meaning in and increase understanding of a situation, resulting in some competitive advantage for your business. This provides more than low-level understanding of an issue, giving you deeper insight into major mechanics related to your particular business.
